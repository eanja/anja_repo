```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Generate the sample
We start sampling 100 values from a log-normal distribution with $\mu=1$ and $\sigma=0.25$:
```{r data}
data <- rlnorm (100, 1, 25)
```

## Plot the histograms
We now create a histogram of the sampled distribution...
```{r histogram, echo=FALSE}
hist(data, breaks=15, freq=FALSE, col="orange")
```

... and a histogram of the same distribution on the log scale:
```{r log histogram, echo=FALSE}
hist(log(data), breaks=15, freq=FALSE, col=rainbow(15))
```

## Mean and variance
At the end we calculate the mean and variance of the sample:
```{r mean and sd}
m <- mean(data)
v <- var(data)
```

The mean is `r m` and the variance is `r v`.
